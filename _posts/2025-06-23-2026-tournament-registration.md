## Registration Details

Registration will be open from **Wednesday, September&nbsp;17, 2025&nbsp;6:00 PM ET** to **Friday, September&nbsp;26, 2025&nbsp;6:00 PM ET**.  
We will guarantee acceptance of schools that meet either of the following qualifications:

- Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year
- Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year

All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a lottery. As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.

Teams will be notified of their acceptance on **Monday, October 6th**, and a public list of participating teams will be announced on **Monday, October 13th**.

## Registration Fee

The registration fee will be **$200** per team. Financial aid will be available for the fee if needed.

Please reach out to <scioly@mit.edu> with any questions. Thank you for your interest in our invitational!
