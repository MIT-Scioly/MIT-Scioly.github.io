    <b>Registration for the 2020 MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament is now closed!</b> Thank you to all teams that applied! Please expect an email from us regarding your acceptance.
</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
    <li>September 18, 2019, 6PM EST: Registration opens</li>
    <li>September 23, 2019, 6PM EST: Registration closes</li>
    <li>September 25, 2019: Accepted teams notified</li>
    <li>October 9, 2019: List of participating teams released</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>
    Schools meeting either of the following two conditions will be guaranteed admission:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year.</li>
    <li>Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
    All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a lottery.
</p>
<p>
    As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.
</p>
<p>
    Schools that would like to bring two teams can fill out an additional question on the registration form regarding why they need to bring two teamsâ€” the answers will be reviewed to make sure as many teams are satisfied as possible.
