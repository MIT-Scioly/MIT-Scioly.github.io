title: Restarting Blogs
---

After 6 years, the MIT Science Olympiad Planning Committee is excited to be bringing blogs back! If you were not aware we had a blog in the first place, we used to post [here](https://medium.com/@mit_scioly) during the 2018-19 SciOly season.

This has been a couple months in the workings now, and we have a good number of posts lined up — you can expect content from our Admin Logistics, Competitor Logistics, Events, Finance, Publicity, and Software sub-committees.

_Um...what’s the point of restarting blogs?_
There are so many reasons! Here are a few:

1. Giving competitors and the general public insight into the behind the scenes of running a Science Olympiad invitational.

2. Contributing to a bank of public knowledge amongst existing and prospective tournament organizers.

3. Clearing up any misconceptions. Some of our policies have changed in the six years we have not been writing blogs, and we still sometimes see people citing our Medium posts.

4. Providing a convenient outlet for our PC members (and potentially ESs) to write on any SciOly-related topic of interest in the future.
