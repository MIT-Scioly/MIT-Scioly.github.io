            Hey, I'm Basil, a freshman without a major in mind! I competed on Troy's varsity SciOly team for four years, two of them as captain. I love ecology and ID events, though I've ended up doing all three chem events as well. Fun fact: I've done an event from every subject category in SciOly. I've helped run Troy Invite in the past, and if you've suffered through a Water Quality, Green Gen, Crime Busters, or Ornithology test, it might have been at my hands. Outside of SciOly, I like birdwatching, drawing, and singing musical theatre.
