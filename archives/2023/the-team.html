                <p>
  Science Olympiad at MIT is an undergraduate student group founded in Fall
  2013 by Connor Duffy (2017) and Kenny Friedman (2017) with the mission of
  improving the Science Olympiad experience of high school students in
  Massachusetts and the greater northeast region. MIT Science Olympiad is
  entirely run by a team of MIT undergraduate
  students. We work around the year both within MIT and in the Massachusetts
  area to promote Science Olympiad opportunities for students. The MIT
  Invitational would not be possible without the dedication and effort of our
  members.
