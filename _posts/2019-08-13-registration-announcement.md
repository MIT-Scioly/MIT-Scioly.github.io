*TL;DR: Registration will be open from Wednesday, September 18th, 2019 at 6PM EST to Monday, September 23rd, at 6PM EST. The form is located [here](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jK9gSmaIYM5HQV).*

We are pleased to announce that registration for the 6th annual MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will open on **Wednesday, September 18th, 2019 at 6PM EST**. The form can be accessed [here](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jK9gSmaIYM5HQV) and will close promptly the following **Monday, September 23rd, at 6PM EST**. Teams will be notified of their acceptance on Wednesday, September 25th, and a public list of participating teams will be announced on Wednesday, October 9th. 

As stated previously, the tournament will take place on Saturday, January 25th at the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We will be running all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events, with a schedule mirroring the National Tournament schedule as closely as possible. All events will be written, reviewed, and run by Science Olympiad alumni currently at MIT, national tournament event supervisors, and/or former Science Olympiad competitors from the highest level of competition. This means that coaches will not be required to write tests or otherwise volunteer at the invitational, leaving them free to focus solely on coaching their own teams. 

A new system of accepting teams will be implemented for this registration cycle. We have eliminated the tier-system, and will instead guarantee acceptance of schools that meet either of the following qualifications: 

* Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year 
* Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year

All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a lottery. As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.

Schools that would like to bring two teams can fill out an additional question on the registration form regarding why they need to bring two teamsâ€” the answers will be reviewed to make sure as many teams are satisfied as possible.

Please do not hesitate to [contact us](scioly.mit.edu/contact-us) if you have any questions. We look forward to the upcoming season!
