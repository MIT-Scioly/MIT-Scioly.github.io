</p>
<ul>
    <li>Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year.</li>
    <li>Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year.</li>

    All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a lottery.
</p>
<p>
    As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.
</p>
<p>
    Schools that would like to bring two teams can fill out an additional question on the registration form regarding why they need to bring two teamsâ€” the answers will be reviewed to make sure as many teams are satisfied as possible.
