The eleventh annual MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will be held on Saturday, January 25th, 2025 on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a tournament we pride ourselves for being as accessible to teams competing for the first time as teams competing for the hundredth time while delivering an experience you can only get at MIT. A few features of our tournament that we think you’ll like:

-   **A full competition experience.** We will run all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events! Each school will have its own home room for the day, and our tournament will conclude with an award ceremony, complete with medals and trophies for top individuals and teams.

-   **Freedom for coaches.** The MIT Invitational is fully staffed by students! This means that coaches will not be required to write tests or otherwise volunteer at the invitational, leaving them free to focus solely on coaching their own teams.

-   **Unparalleled quality.** All of our tests are written by former Science Olympians who have competed at the highest levels. In addition each test is then vetted extensively by members of our team to ensure that students only receive the best.

-   **Worry-free tournament.** With five years of the MIT Science Olympiad Invitational already in the books and years of collective national-level experience under our belts, we know how invitationals work. Sit back, relax, and be treated to a tournament that neither wind, rain, nor fire alarms can stop.

-   **Nationals schedule.** Tired of navigating the changes in event conflicts from tournament to tournament? Our tournament will mirror the event conflicts of the national tournament as closely as possible, allowing teams to put their best foot forward on competition day.

-   **The MIT experience.** Where better to host a Science Olympiad competition than at the mecca of science and engineering pedagogy and research? Competitors will get a chance to see the beauty and craziness of MIT with campus tours on competition day. We are always happy to answer your questions about MIT admissions, college admissions in general, MIT life, or college life in general.
