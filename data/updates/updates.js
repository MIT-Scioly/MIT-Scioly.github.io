    //     "content": "<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>It is with great excitment that we announce the first year of our new Division A tournament. We are eager to begin blazing new paths in furthering science outreach and are ready to welcome elementary-school students onto our campus.</p><p>Naturally, this necessitates the discontinuation of our Division C tournament. Please note that this was not an easy decision to make. These last 5 years have been a flurry of fun, agitation, and adolescent brilliance. We’ve administered over 700 exams and tested too many builds. But perhaps, the greatest treasure was the friends we made along the way. Science Olympiad has always been about teamwork and collaboration. In Division D, invitationals have been a great way for people with the same goals and passions to group together.</p><p>We would like to give a major thanks to all of the following groups:</p><ul><li>All the teams that come out to our tournament every year. It was amazing to see what y'all could come up with, and heartwarming to see you all support each other through the stresses of high school and Science Olympiad. A big shout-out to all those teams which have to transport (and rebuild) their device, and to all the coaches, who often work long and hard (and often unpaid) hours to make sure their teams run smoothly.</li><li>The event supervisors, who worked long and hard on quality exams and watchful proctoring. The passion you all have for your events, and science in general, is inspirational. We enjoyed meeting each and every one of you. </li><li>All of our keynote speakers and Awards Ceremony people, for years of interesting and amusing speeches (and stalling). </li><li>The MIT Administration, for cultivating our ambitions and lending us rooms. </li><li>Last but not least: our founders, for their grit and energy. Without you, this tournament would not have become what it is today. Thank you, each of you, for contributing your own unique talents and passing on this tournament to us.</li></ul><p>There are many reasons for our sudden decision, but fundamentally, it comes down to the fact that five years is a very long time. There are now so many Division C invitational tournaments that have arisen in the past few years, many of which are well-run. We feel that Division C is in good hands and have thus set our eyes on new, uncharted territory for college invitationals.</p><p>All that being said, we are extremely excited to be transitioning our efforts to hosting a fantastic and rewarding Division A experience!</p><p>Many details have yet to be determined, but there are three things on which we have already decided:</p><ol><li>First, the only event will be Fossils Find. More events, such as Pentathlon, may be added to the roster as our events research proceeds.</li><li>Second, there is a part of our current fossils collection that will make an appearance at this event. Other materials from past tournaments, such as gummy bears, may also make an appearance. We will do our best to utilize our inventory. </li><li>And third, we will be buying fossils plushies to create a prehistoric “petting zoo” for our young competitors.</li></ol><p>Thank you all for your patronage throughout the years. We are happy and honored to have hosted you all and are excited to see where these new endeavors take us.</p>"

        'Hi Everyone!<br><br><p>Registration will open September 19th, at 7PM EST. We’ll run all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events, with a schedule mirroring the National Tournament schedule as closely as possible. As before, all events will be written, reviewed, and run by Science Olympiad alumni currently at MIT, national tournament event supervisors, and/or former Science Olympiad competitors from the highest levels of competition. This means that coaches will not be required to write tests or otherwise volunteer at the invitational, leaving them free to focus solely on coaching their own teams. And, of course, competitors will experience the beauty and craziness of MIT.<br><br>The registration form is located <a href="https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6PuLrc4v7ikAiq1">here</a>.</p><br><p>In light of the rapidly decreasing registration times we have seen in the past few years, we have decided to transition towards a tiered lottery system to allow a diverse pool of competitors while still maintaining the rigor of our tournament. Schools will be lotteried according to the highest ranked tier they are in. If a school is not selected by lottery from the highest tier they are initially placed in, they will be dropped to the next tier that they qualify for and will be lotteried once more. The tiers are listed below:</p><br>1. Top 10 teams at the MIT Invitational in the previous year: all ten teams will be automatically accepted if they submit an application<br>2. Schools qualifying for Nationals in the previous year: out of the teams that submit an application, 15 teams will be chosen by lottery. Teams that qualify for Tier 2 but do not make it as a Tier 2 team are added Tier 4.<br>3. Massachusetts Schools: 20 teams will be selected from this pool ensuring that at least 20 Massachusetts teams are able to come to our competition. Teams that qualify for Tier 3 but do not make it as a Tier 3 team are added Tier 4.<br>4. General pool: depending on how many spots are remaining, schools will be selected by a lottery process<br><br><p>Schools that would like to bring two teams can fill out a brief application regarding why they need to bring two teams— the applications will be reviewed to make sure as many people are satisfied as possible. Tier 2, 3, and 4 are randomly selected from the applicants at the end of every week until the all the slots are full. The cutoff for the first selection is 11:59PM Friday, September 21st. If there are any spots still available after the first selection, the next selection will be held approximately one week later. Please apply as early as you can.</p><br>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. We thank you for your support of MIT Science Olympiad.<br><br>Best,<br>MIT Science Olympiad'
