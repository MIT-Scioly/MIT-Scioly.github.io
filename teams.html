<h2>Day-Of Registration</h2>
<p>
    Registration is mandatory for all teams—one coach from each school must come to registration. At registration, you will receive, per team:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>15 competitor wristbands</li>
    <li>0-4 alternate wristbands</li>
    <li>1 team list (includes homeroom)</li>
    <li>1 campus map</li>
    <li>1 parking map</li>
    <li>1 information brochure (explained below).</li>
    <li>1 schedule</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We’ll also communicate any important day-of updates. We will also be using <b>Remind 101</b> to communicate urgent updates with coaches day-of.  At registration, we will have coaches sign up and confirm that the system works for them.
</p>

<p>
    You can attend registration on either <b>Friday, January 24 from 5-7pm or on Saturday, January 25 from 6-8am</b>. You must attend registration during one of these times, but there is no need to go to both times. Registration will be held in HQ: <b>10-105, known as the Bush Room</b>.
