<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<p>Registration is mandatory for all teams — one coach from each school must come to registration.</p>

<p>You can attend registration on either Friday, January 19th from 5-7 PM or on Saturday, January 20th from 6:30-8 AM. You must attend registration during one of these times, but there is no need to go to both times. Registration will be held in the tournament HQ: 10-105, known as the Bush Room. At registration, you will receive wristbands and other documents such as maps and schedules.</p>

<h2 id="campus-access">Campus Access</h2>

<p>All coaches must sign up for Tim Tickets to gain access to campus on tournament day. Please do this at least one day before you arrive on competition day. Note that due to updated MIT policies, Tim Tickets are only intended for use by adults (i.e. coaches and parent chaperones). When entering MIT buildings, competitors should be with coaches/parents with Tim Tickets or ask nearby MIT Science Olympiad staff/volunteers.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Please also note that any member of your team (competitors, coach, parent, etc.) may not access homerooms before 6 AM on Saturday, January 20th, and any event rooms before 8:30 AM on Saturday, January 20th (unless impounding in which case you may not enter before 7:15 AM). If you do so, your team will be disqualified from the event in question. This is due to fairness of competition and the specifics of our room reservations.</p>
