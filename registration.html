<h2>Registration Details</h2>
<p>
    Registration will be open from <strong>Wednesday, September 18th, 2024 at 6 PM ET</strong> to <strong>Friday, September
        27th, 2024 at 6 PM ET</strong>.
    We will guarantee acceptance of schools that meet either of the following qualifications:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year</li>
    <li>Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a
    lottery. As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also
    upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially
    Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.
</p>

<p>
    Teams will be notified of their acceptance on <strong>Monday, October 7th</strong>, and a public list of
    participating teams will be announced on <strong>Monday, October 14th</strong>.
