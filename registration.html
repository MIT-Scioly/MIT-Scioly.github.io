    Registration will be open from <strong>Friday, September 16th, 2022 at 6 PM ET</strong> to <strong>Friday, September

    We will guarantee acceptance of schools that meet either of the following qualifications:

    All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a
    lottery. As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also
    upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially
    Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.
