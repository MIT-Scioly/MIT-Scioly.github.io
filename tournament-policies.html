<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unless otherwise stated, the MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will follow all national-level rules as stated in the official rule book and the official, national-level rule clarifications regardless of state-level rule changes or clarifications adopted by Massachusetts, the West Suburban Science League, or any other state organization.
    </li>
    <li>Each team must be accompanied to the MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament by at least one unique adult.  (In other words, schools which send two teams to the MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament must be accompanied by at least two adults on competition day.)</li>

        Teams must abide by the Science Olympiad code of ethics and general rules specified <a href="https://www.soinc.org/code-ethics-general-rules">here</a>. In particular:
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

            <li>All pre-built devices presented for judging must be constructed, impounded, and operated by one or more of the 15 current team members unless stated otherwise in the rules.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Wristband Procedures</h2>
<p>
    We will be using wristbands on competition day to identify the competitors. Please observe the following notes about wristbands.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Students will not be allowed to compete without wristbands, so please make sure you have 15 wristbands in your package. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Team members MUST have wristbands.</li>
    <li>Accepting the coaches package constitutes an agreement that you have verified that the correct number of wristbands are in your packet. Wristbands will also be required for Trial Events.</li>
    <li>Wristbands should be secured onto the wrists of the 15 competing team members and should be tight enough so as to not be able to slip off.</li>
    <li>If a wristband is defective or damaged, the coach and student must bring the band to headquarters for validation and replacement before they are allowed to compete.</li>
    <li>Event supervisors will check for wristbands before the event begins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arbitration</h2>
<p>
    Arbitration can be conducted if a competitor or coach feels that an event was not run in accordance with the rules. Please observe the following notes about arbitration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Should you choose to arbitrate an event, first inform the Event Supervisor so that he or she can note the details of what happened.</li>
    <li>Bring your complaint to the tournament headquarters where the Arbitration Committee will be. You will be asked to write down a description of your dispute as well as the particular rule(s) you believe were violated.</li>
    <li>In the case of a build event arbitration, YOU MUST LEAVE THE BUILD AT THE TESTING LOCATION AFTER THE RUN IN CONTENTION. If a build is removed from the testing location, we cannot arbitrate, regardless of the point of contention.</li>
</ul>
