            Hi! I’m Amber, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Math (6-3 + 18), with specific interests in computational biology. I was Captain of Ward Melville Science Olympiad and competed in Science Olympiad for 4 years, where my favorite events were Anatomy & Physiology and Protein Modeling. I’ve also supervised A & P for BirdSO and SOLVI. In addition to MIT Scioly, I’m also a member of the MIT Asian Dance Team and Momentum AI, and am conducting a UROP on RNA splicing in the Burge Lab. In my free time, I enjoy binge-watching TV shows and playing Super Smash Bros.

            Hi! I'm Elisa, and I am a sophomore at MIT majoring in Artificial Intelligence & Decision Making (Course 6-4). In high school, I was a Captain for the Chattahoochee HS Science Olympiad team in Georgia where I competed for 4 years. My favorite events were Forensics, Codebusters, and Chemistry Lab. Science Olympiad was a major part of my high school experience, and I am excited to contribute back to the community through the MIT SciOly! Outside of SciOly, I'm also involved with the MIT Biotech Group and MIT IEEE/ACM.

            Hi! My name is Amber, and I'm currently a sophomore studying computer science (6-3). I'm from Southern California, where I competed for 3 years in high school as part of Troy's Science Olympiad team. My favorite events are definitely Codebusters and Experimental Design. In school, I'm involved in Asian Dance Team and Pistoling Club. Outside of class, I enjoy playing music (flute and erhu!), writing short stories, and exploring Boston!

            Hi! I'm Tyler, a sophomore from Hawaii studying biological engineering (Course 20). Before MIT, I competed for Iolani where my favorite events were Astronomy, Cell Biology, and Protein Modeling. I'm also in Pi Lambda Phi and play tuba for MIT Wind Ensemble and the Video Game Orchestra. I also enjoy picking up new hobbies - last semester, I became SCUBA certified and learned how to solve a Rubix's Cube. In my spare time, I usually chase Derek Chen around to get help on homework.

            Hey, I'm Basil, a freshman without a major in mind! I competed on Troy's varsity SciOly team for four years, two of them as captain. I love ecology and ID events, though I've ended up doing all three chem events as well. Fun fact: I've done an event from every subject category in SciOly. I've helped run Troy Invite in the past, and if you've suffered through a Water Quality, Green Gen, Crime Busters, or Ornithology test, it might have been at my hands. Outside of SciOly, I like birdwatching, drawing, and singing musical theatre.

            Hi! I'm Richard, a first year planning on studying chemistry and biology (course 5-7). In high school, I was a captain for Belmont, MA where my favorite events included A&P, Chem Lab, and Fermi Questions. Throughout my experience competing in Scioly, I appreciated the opportunity to make new friends, learn new things, and share lots of memories, and I'm excited to keep contributing to this community!

            Hi, I’m Heidi! I’m a freshman thinking about majoring in some combination of math and computer science, but still very undecided.  In high school, I competed and captained for Belmont High School and my favorite event was Rocks and Minerals (<333). I also really enjoyed Codebusters, Write It Do It/CAD It, and Dynamic Planet. Outside of SciOly, I’m also involved with the Ohms (an a cappella group!), HMMT, and Asian Dance Team! In my free time, you can find me doing crosswords, imagining working out at the gym, and fully taking advantage of P/NR.
