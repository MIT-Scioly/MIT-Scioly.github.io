The Publicity committee at MIT SciOly takes care of the media presence and outward appearance of the club! We basically decide how MIT SciOly wants to present itself to the general public, which is honestly a lotttt of power.

Some of the main things we do include managing our social media and designing merchandise. The specifics of what we do is mostly up to the individual members to initiate — part of the reason I love Publicity is I can do whatever I want and people go along with it :D We also work pretty independently compared to other committees, meeting in-person occasionally but doing most of our work asynchronously.

In this post, I’ll specifically cover the social media/marketing side of Publicity, which has been my main role so far.

**Branding**

When thinking about how we want to brand our tournament, MIT SciOly is lucky to have carved out a niche for itself already. Being generally recognized for having difficult (but high-quality) tests and attracting top-tier teams is both good and bad: It’s awesome that our tournament is overall highly regarded, but we also don’t want to be super unapproachable. In addition, running a large tournament like MIT means that if something goes wrong, everyone hears about it which can be a little scary.

Ultimately, the vision we have is for the tournament to present a high-quality experience from the first time you hear about MIT SciOly to the moment you leave our campus. It’s of course not something we succeed in completely, but as a club we do work very hard towards this goal. Over the past two years, I think we’ve been trying to push our graphics and marketing materials towards being more representative of our tournament as a whole: cohesive (think our bright-color-against-black color scheme + the green-blue gradient logo), professional, but still fun and exciting!

**Marketing**

Our biggest audience comes from our Instagram account [@mit_scioly](https://www.instagram.com/mit_scioly/?hl=en), which I believe is the second-largest SciOly related Instagram account (HUSO, I’m coming for you). We also have a small presence on Discord – this year, I kind of took on the role of “Unofficial MIT SciOly liaison”. A very chill job overall, I just did a search every once in a while in the Science Olympiad-related servers to see if there were any questions or misconceptions floating around about us.

Again, MIT SciOly is lucky to be a pretty well-known tournament already; ES and competitor recruitment are two things we usually don’t have to worry about too much. So, that lets us spend a lot more time on fun initiatives – this year, the account has been the most active it’s ever been and we sort of had a different focus/project for every month of the year.

**Timeline**

October: New member intros done by Keona and Eleni! We welcomed 13(!) new PC members this year and we were very excited to introduce them. Until Instagram changed the aspect ratio :((((

November: We had around ten PC members do Instagram takeovers on our story! Credit goes to UCSD Science Olympiad(?) for being the first college SciOly club to do takeovers (that I saw). I think takeovers are super fun for both the audience and the person doing the takeover, but they can get a little stale after a while. However, it definitely boosted our engagement a lot.

December: Volunteer recruitment is actually something we stress out a lot about — our goal is usually to recruit at least 100 volunteers to keep our tournament running smoothly. Definitely something we need to keep working on. For this, we advertise on Instagram, Discord, MIT mailing lists, and physical flyers.

January: Unsurprisingly our busiest month on social media. We started doing the 7-day countdown two years ago with daily posts for the seven days leading up to the tournament. This year, we upgraded (thanks Keona!) both graphically and content-wise. Last year, I had to learn how to (very badly) use Adobe Illustrator and we just posted the names of a few event supervisors every day. This year, since the list of Event Supervisor was already public on the website, we wanted to make the countdown more interesting! We alternated between PC and ES
introductions and also gave some insight into what each of the PC committees do.

As for making reels, I really just wanted to try something different. Nothing too crazy since we were just trying stuff out, but the reels we did make seemed to be pretty popular with our audience, though the event supervisors really upstaged the planning committee in terms of reel performance… Huge thanks to the PC and ESs who appeared in the videos either voluntarily or involuntarily though! Can’t wait to make more videos soon and finally achieve my dreams of becoming a famous influencer! Just kidding, but you can feel free to send me ideas for new videos at heidi@mit.edu.

Post-tournament: After our tournament concluded, we’ve been a lot less active on the Instagram account. We posted some pictures from the tournament and then decided to chill out a bit. Except… we were actually working on blogs! Throughout March, we were setting up and writing drafts of blog posts, which will be coming

We also did an April Fool’s post that quickly became our most-liked and most-shared post by a wide margin! Shoutout to Elisa for the idea and Richard for helping out with the writing.

Our most viewed content: the April Fool’s Post, the tournament day + thank you posts, volunteering, and two of our reels! This is pretty much exactly what we expected/what we would want which is great.

**Conclusion**

You should join MIT Science Olympiad! (Or help out with a nearby invitational in college). There is such a wide variety of roles needed to keep a tournament running – I tell people “I just make the silly little Instagram posts”, but marketing is honestly a pretty important role. A lot of it is also just based on what we think competitors and high schoolers will enjoy, so we try to do stuff that we think will be interesting/fun/useful for people to know.
