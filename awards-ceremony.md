The Awards Ceremony for the 2021 Invitational will take place at **6 pm EST on Sunday, January 31st**. The event will be live-streamed on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/zvihJ5qipSE).

Due to the large number of teams at our competition, we'll be announcing the **top 15 placings** in each event. Medals will be given to the top 10 placings in each event (trial events included).

For overall team placings, we will announce the top 15 schools. That is, if two teams from the same school place in the top 15, we'll only announce the higher-placing team (and the school that placed 16th will be announced as 15th, provided that no other team from that school already placed in the top 15).

We hope to see you there!
