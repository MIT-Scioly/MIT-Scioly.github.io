    There are several steps coaches, competitors, and parents can take to ensure their health and safety while on campus.
    <h2>MIT Mobile App</h2>
    <p>
        It is recommended that you download the <a href="https://ist.mit.edu/mit-mobile-app">MIT Mobile App</a> while on campus. The app provides a campus map as well as shuttle location updates.
    </p>
    <h2>MIT Police</h2>
    <p>
        Once you are on campus, if you or any team members as an urgent medical emergency, please call the MIT Police at 617-253-1212. Please do not call 911 because the MIT Police are more familiar with the MIT campus and can respond more quickly. MIT has an ambulance that can transport you to a local hospital. If you have a non-emergency medical problem during the day, then you should visit Mass General Hospital’s Medical Walk-In Unit at:
    </p>
    <p>
        Wang Ambulatory Care Center<br>
        Suite 108<br>
        15 Parkman Street<br>
        Boston, MA 02114<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        If at any time you feel unsafe around MIT’s campus, or you are unable to find a member of your team, call the MIT Police. Once again, their number is <b>617-253-1212</b>, or <b>100</b> if you are dialing from a campus phone. If you are outside, you can also use one of the emergency telephones on campus, identified by bright blue lights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, we would like to keep track of all situations in which first aid, MIT Police, or any medical intervention was required, so we can understand what incidents occurred and keep improving the process for future years. If you are a coach managing an emergency situation, once things have calmed down enough to let you return to a computer, please email a summary of the situation to the email we distributed in our email to teams.
    </p>

    <h2>MIT Emergency</h2>
    <p>
        In the event of an emergency, announcements will be posted at <a href="https://emergency.mit.net">emergency.mit.net</a>. At this site, you can also sign up for MIT's emergency notification system, MIT ALERT, which will also send any updates to your email and cell phone.
    </p>

    <h2>MIT Medical</h2>
    <p>
        MIT Medical's 24-hour urgent care number is (617) 253-4481. Medical is located in building E23 on the far east side of campus.
