    As is the procedure at the national tournament, due to space constraints, up to 16 people per team (usually, the 15 competing students plus 1 coach) may sit in the awards ceremony main venue (Kresge Auditorium, W16-109) for the awards ceremony.  Additional tournament attendees may watch a live streaming video of the awards ceremony in the overflow seating location, in the same building.

    Attire is casual â€” we expect that most students will wear the same clothes that they wore to the competition.  If possible, teams should bring all their belongings to the awards ceremony so that they can proceed directly to buses at the conclusion of the ceremony.
    Medals will be awarded to the top six teams in each event and trophies will be awarded to the top six schools at the tournament.  Only the top-placing team from each school will be considered for a trophy.
