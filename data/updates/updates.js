As always, safety glasses and proper PPE are required. Failing to comply with the rules will result in competitors being asked to leave the lab as well as mockery by the proctors. In the past, people have had trouble finding the lab. There will be signage to direct competitors on the day of, but to avoid stress during the competition, we advise that you find the location of the lab the night before the tournament. We have also included a map below which will be provided with your coach's information packet.</p><img src=\"https://mit-scioly.github.io/images/map.png\" alt=\"Map\" class=\"post-image\">"

As such, we feel that it is only fair to everyone that we replace Chem Lab, an inferior and yearly event, to make space for the ultimate and renowned test of computer science ability.</p> <img src=\"https://mit-scioly.github.io/images/scratch.png\" alt=\"Map\" class=\"post-image\">"

In celebration of the 5th anniversary of the MIT Invitational Tournament, we are holding a t-shirt design contest for our official tournament t-shirt. We are accepting designs for a SciOly-themed shirt, preferably with emphasis on the tournament’s 5th birthday (though any SciOly-themed design will be welcomed). Some possible ideas to incorporate can be the Great Dome, Tim the Beaver, your favorite SciOly events, and other science-y topics. Be creative!<br><br>Designs will be reviewed and selected by the current MIT Science Olympiad Planning Committee, and the winning team will receive free t-shirts for all team members. We encourage all teams to participate, as this is a fun opportunity to show off your artistic talents (in addition to scientific ones) and represent your school in the SciOly community! Teams are welcome to submit multiple designs. Please email your designs to scioly-2019-tshirts@mit.edu by November 20th, 2018. We will announce the winning team by December 1st, 2018.<br><br>Please let us know if you have any questions. We look forward to seeing some great designs!"

We’ll run all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events, with a schedule mirroring the National Tournament schedule as closely as possible. As before, all events will be written, reviewed, and run by Science Olympiad alumni currently at MIT, national tournament event supervisors, and/or former Science Olympiad competitors from the highest levels of competition. This means that coaches will not be required to write tests or otherwise volunteer at the invitational, leaving them free to focus solely on coaching their own teams. And, of course, competitors will experience the beauty and craziness of MIT.<br><br>The registration form is located <a href=\"https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6PuLrc4v7ikAiq1\">here</a>.</p><br><p>In light of the rapidly decreasing registration times we have seen in the past few years, we have decided to transition towards a tiered lottery system to allow a diverse pool of competitors while still maintaining the rigor of our tournament. Schools will be lotteried according to the highest ranked tier they are in. If a school is not selected by lottery from the highest tier they are initially placed in, they will be dropped to the next tier that they qualify for and will be lotteried once more. The tiers are listed below:</p><br>1. Top 10 teams at the MIT Invitational in the previous year: all ten teams will be automatically accepted if they submit an application<br>2. Schools qualifying for Nationals in the previous year: out of the teams that submit an application, 15 teams will be chosen by lottery. Teams that qualify for Tier 2 but do not make it as a Tier 2 team are added Tier 4.<br>3. Massachusetts Schools: 20 teams will be selected from this pool ensuring that at least 20 Massachusetts teams are able to come to our competition. Teams that qualify for Tier 3 but do not make it as a Tier 3 team are added Tier 4.<br>4. General pool: depending on how many spots are remaining, schools will be selected by a lottery process<br><br><p>Schools that would like to bring two teams can fill out a brief application regarding why they need to bring two teams— the applications will be reviewed to make sure as many people are satisfied as possible. Tier 2, 3, and 4 are randomly selected from the applicants at the end of every week until the all the slots are full. The cutoff for the first selection is 11:59PM Friday, September 21st. If there are any spots still available after the first selection, the next selection will be held approximately one week later. Please apply as early as you can.</p><br>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. We thank you for your support of MIT Science Olympiad.<br><br>Best,<br>MIT Science Olympiad"
