title: "2022 Tournament Date"
---

We are pleased to announce that the 8th annual MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will take place on **Saturday and Sunday, January 22-23rd, 2022**. We currently plan to hold the tournament in-person at the MIT campus. However, with the ongoing situation with COVID-19, we may transition to an online format depending on MIT guidelines and state/national policies. We will make corresponding announcements if there are any changes to the tournament format. In case of an in-person tournament, we will be running all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events. All events will be written, reviewed, and run by Science Olympiad alumni currently at MIT, national tournament event supervisors, and/or former Science Olympiad competitors from the highest level of competition. This means that coaches will not be required to write tests or otherwise volunteer at the invitational, leaving them free to focus solely on coaching their own teams.

Registration will open on **Wednesday, September 15th, 2021 at 6 PM ET** and will close the following **Wednesday, September 22nd at 6 PM ET**. More details about registration will be available on our website closer to the date. Teams will be notified of their acceptance on Monday, October 4th, and a public list of participating teams will be announced on Monday, October 11th. In the event that we change to an online format, we may accept additional teams at a later date.

We will guarantee acceptance of schools that meet either of the following qualifications:

- Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year
- Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year

We look forward to the upcoming season!
