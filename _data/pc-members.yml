        I'm Julie, a junior studying Computer Science (6-3) and minoring in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (9). While competing in Div C (Palo Alto), I really enjoyed Anatomy & Physiology, Geologic Mapping, and Herpetology. It’s been incredibly rewarding to give back to the organization that helped me make so many good memories and friends. I'm also involved with Asian Dance Team, MedLinks, and Pi Beta Phi. In my free time, I love to bake, run (aka prevent baked goods from turning me into a potato), and play the ukulele.

      #   Hello! I'm Melissa, class of 2024, and I'm hoping to study biology and computer science. I went to high school in Minnesota, where I participated in Science Olympiad every year and served as captain in senior year. My favorite event was Anatomy & Physiology, although Microbe Mission was a great time too before it was cycled out. Science Olympiad was one of my highlights from high school, and I hope that I can help inspire that same passion in others. Aside from science, I really like to draw! I mostly do digital art and sometimes dabble in graphic design.
