<h2>Wright Stuff</h2>
<p>
    Wright Stuff will be held in Rockwell Gymnasium. The ceiling height is 40 ft, but there is a network of support girders covered by a net suspended underneath. The effective ceiling height (to the bottom of the girders) is 28 ft which is what you should expect to be flying at. The first image shows the venue for the timed flights. The second image shows the adjacent gym which will be used for trim flights.
