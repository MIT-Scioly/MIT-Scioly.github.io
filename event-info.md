Note that **all events follow national rules. Online notes are not allowed unless specifically noted in the rules (i.e. Astronomy)**. Please read carefully (especially for building events) for specific implementations of events for this year’s tournament.

### Required Material
Some event(s) require some materials beforehand. Please make sure you have access to them on the tournament day. These are basic office supplies, so acquiring them should not be difficult, but if you come into problems, feel free to email scioly@mit.edu. 

Required per team on tournament day:

- Experimental Design
    - ~ 25 pieces of 8.5x11 paper
    - Scissors
    - Time-measuring device
    - Linear measuring device

- Write It Do It
    - One (1) red pen
    - One (1) blue pen
    - One (1) black pen
    - Two (2) individual (i.e., sheets, not pads) Post-it notes (3 x 3 inches, color does not matter)
