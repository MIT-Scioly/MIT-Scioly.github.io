title: "Tournament Info Update"
---

We hope you're all excited for our tournament in less than a month! Here are some important updates for all competing teams; please read through everything carefully.

### Tournament Guide

We have compiled a [Tournament Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19OXCrNPKrqK5xJUUyD7zjELtTYwvV-O86TXvcg11XxA/edit?usp=sharing) with all essential tournament-related information for your convenience. The biggest update is that **we will not be using Scilympiad this year, and instead we will be using Gradescope for scanning/uploading answer sheets**. This change is also detailed in the guide.

### Release Form

Please complete the release form [here](https://scioly.mit.edu/release-form/). All competitors **must fill out the information at this link and finish signing the release form in Docusign**.

### Builds

Detailed build device testing information is coming soon, but in general, build events will work as follows. For the initial submission, teams have virtually infinite tries to submit a video with clear demonstration of their performance and their check-in process as well as a self-scored spreadsheet the ES will verify based on the video. Most videos are to be submitted by 1/16/22. 
**Important: some events require you to film and submit at a specific time window during the week of 1/10/22 - 1/16/22. There will be multiple windows to accommodate different teams’ schedules/availability**.

### T-Shirts

You can purchase a T-shirt for $10.13 each through [here](https://www.customink.com/g/wux0-00ch-vbvw) by 1/26/22.

### For In-person Teams Only

[New MIT COVID policies](https://now.mit.edu/policies/campus-access-and-visitors/) due to the omicron variant require all individuals coming to campus to have received their COVID-19 booster if eligible. As MIT has been updating their policies recently due to the omicron variant, please be flexible in your planning for coming to campus. We will notify you on any policy changes that affect our in-person component of the tournament. Thank you for your understanding.
