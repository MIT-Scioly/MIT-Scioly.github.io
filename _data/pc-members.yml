            Hello! I’m Jonah, a sophomore majoring in Biological Engineering (Course 20). I competed for duPont Manual HS and my favorite events were Anatomy, Designer Genes, and Protein Modeling. Scioly was the bedrock of my high school years, so I’m excited to give back at MIT! On campus, you can also find me culturing bacteria in the BioMaker Space, studying kinases, and waiting in a stir fry line. Off campus, I’m likely slurping ramen with friends, on the Green Line, or attempting to grind in Boston Public Library!

            Hi! I'm Elisa, a junior majoring in Artificial Intelligence & Decision Making (Course 6-4). In high school, I was a captain for the Chattahoochee HS Science Olympiad team in Georgia, and my favorite events were Forensics, Codebusters, and Chemistry Lab. Science Olympiad was a major part of my high school experience, and I am excited to contribute back to the community through the MIT SciOly! Outside of SciOly, I'm co-president of MIT IEEE/ACM, and I do healthcare AI research. In my free time, I enjoy painting, reading, and baking.

            Hi! I'm Tyler, a sophomore from Hawaii studying biological engineering (Course 20). Before MIT, I competed for Iolani where my favorite events were Astronomy, Cell Biology, and Protein Modeling. I'm also in Pi Lambda Phi and play tuba for MIT Wind Ensemble and the Video Game Orchestra. I also enjoy picking up new hobbies - last semester, I became SCUBA certified and learned how to solve a Rubix's Cube. In my spare time, I usually chase Derek Chen around to get help on homework.

            Hey, I'm Basil, a freshman without a major in mind! I competed on Troy's varsity SciOly team for four years, two of them as captain. I love ecology and ID events, though I've ended up doing all three chem events as well. Fun fact: I've done an event from every subject category in SciOly. I've helped run Troy Invite in the past, and if you've suffered through a Water Quality, Green Gen, Crime Busters, or Ornithology test, it might have been at my hands. Outside of SciOly, I like birdwatching, drawing, and singing musical theatre.

My favorite event is Ping Pong Parachute followed closely by Scrambler, Gravity Vehicle, and Trajectory. Having competed in Science Olympiad since 5th grade, it is a community and an experience I hold very dear. I am extremely grateful and eager to be on the other side of the competition, working to bring Scioly to all of you! Cheez-Its are superior to Goldfish, I love Disney, and ducks are my favorite animal!
