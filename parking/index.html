          A Drop-off and Parking Map will be added for the locations of drop-off, pick-up, and
          bus parking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please have buses drop off students along Amherst Street (facing west). We recommend setting your GPS to 32 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA to find the correct Amherst Street because there are two Amherst Streets in Cambridge. <b>Please note that buses may only stop along the westbound side of Amherst Street, accessible only from Massachusetts Avenue.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterwards, buses should proceed to one of the two parking locations marked on the map, either 65 Waverly Street or 195 Albany Street.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buses should pick up students on Amherst Street at the conclusion of the awards ceremony in the evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals or teams arriving at the tournament by car may park in any of the seven lots listed under “Parking at MIT without a Permit” near the bottom of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html"> this page</a>. Among those seven lots, the building 44/46 lot is closest to the main part of campus.
