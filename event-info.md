## Event-Specific Information

As a reminder, MIT Invitationals will be following nationals rules with any rules clarified on [this page](https://www.soinc.org/events/rules-clarifications).

Updates on other events may be added in the future.

### Astronomy

At least one competitor must bring a cell phone with internet connection and access to email for MIT wifi verification.

### Boomilever

For the 2026 Invitational, the Event Supervisors plan to use the same Test Apparatus (as defined in rule 6.) from prior years (see photo 1, which shows the setup for Boomilever) with modifications to the Test Base layout to meet current specifications (in rules 6.b.i-v.). Sand will be used for the free-flowing material (as specified in rule 7.f.). The event will be in a different room, 34-101 (see photo2), from prior years. All participants must bring their own type “B” eye protection. While the Event Supervisors will make every effort to run the event as planned, competitors should be prepared for any adjustments from prior years’ setup that may be necessary to allow the event to run; these may include but are not limited to changes to the Test Apparatus, changes to the free-flowing material, and changes to how sand is loaded.
