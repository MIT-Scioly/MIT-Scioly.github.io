title: Self Scheduling Opening Today
---

Self scheduling will be opening today (December 10) at 5 PM EST. All teams who filled out the roster form by the December 5 deadline have been added to our Avogadro tournament and should now be able to access the tournament. For more detailed instructions, see this [step-by-step guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NnbKyfDUmG46N7p-fMm6TEYCeh62gjjDbDYpnZ5Vka4/edit?usp=sharing).

**If you have any problems during the self-scheduling process, please email [scioly-web@mit.edu](mailto:scioly-web@mit.edu?subject=MIT Scioly Self Scheduling Problem) for the fastest response time.**

If you have not already filled out the form or did not provide us with your username, then you should fill out that form immediately. Please see the [Required Forms](http://scioly.mit.edu/required-forms) page. Self-scheduling slots fill up on a first-come-first serve basis, so we will be monitoring the submission page to try and process late roster form submissions in the order they are received but bear in mind that there may be delays of possibly a couple hours for you to be added.
