We are pleased to announce that the 11th annual MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will take place in-person on **Saturday, January 25th, 2025** at the MIT campus. We will be running all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events. All events will be written, reviewed, and run by Science Olympiad alumni currently at MIT, national tournament event supervisors, and/or former Science Olympiad competitors from the highest level of competition. This means that coaches will not be required to write tests or otherwise volunteer at the invitational, leaving them free to focus solely on coaching their own teams.

More details about registration will be released soon!

<!--Registration will open on **Friday, September 15th, 2023 at 6 PM ET** and will close the following **Monday, September 25th at 6 PM ET**. More details about registration will be available on our website shortly. Teams will be notified of their acceptance on Monday, October 2nd, and a public list of participating teams will be announced on Monday, October 9th.

We will guarantee acceptance of schools that meet either of the following qualifications:

- Schools that have placed Top 10 at the MIT Invitational the previous year
- Schools that have placed Top 10 at the National Tournament the previous year

All teams that do not meet the qualifications for guaranteed acceptance will have their acceptance determined by a lottery. As we continue to grow our tournament, we aim to maintain a diverse pool of competitors while also upholding the rigor of our tournament. As such, we still strongly encourage all teams to apply, especially Massachusetts teams, regardless of their reputation or experience level.

Schools that would like to bring two teams can fill out an additional question on the registration form regarding why they need to bring two teamsâ€” the answers will be reviewed to make sure as many teams are satisfied as possible.

Please do not hesitate to contact us at scioly@mit.edu if you have any questions. We look forward to the upcoming season!
