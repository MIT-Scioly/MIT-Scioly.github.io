Please note that there is limited seating, so only 15 students + 1 coach will be allowed to enter the main auditorium per team (we will be checking wristbands). There will be assigned seating by team.

    If you have more team members or parents that would like to watch, please note that we will have two overflow rooms: Kresge Rehearsal Room A (W16-033) and Kresge Rehearsal Room B (W16-030). Volunteers will be in Kresge lobby to direct to the overflow rooms.

    We will reiterate this on the day of, but please note the following: we will be awarding medals to the top 6 places in each event (including the three trial events). We will be awarding trophies to the top 6 schools. Note that we are awarding trophies to the top schools, not teams. For instance, if two teams from the same school both place in the top 6, the higher placing team will be awarded the trophy.
