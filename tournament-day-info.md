## Campus Map

A color-coded and labelled campus map with suggested paths can be found [here](docs/2026_map.png).

## Homeroom Policies

Due to custodial requirements, homeroom check out should be completed by 6 PM. We cannot guarantee access or security of items stored in rooms beyond 6 PM.

As teams leave their homerooms, please make sure the following tasks are complete:

* Put all trash in trash bags (supplied at registration) and place the bags outside the door
* Remove the team sign on the door
* Erase the chalkboards
* Return tables and chairs to their original configuration.

Per MIT policies, please avoid eating inside your homerooms – tables and seating at the Forbes Family Cafe in the Stata Center (Building 32) will be open for use. Catered food should be delivered to Stata as well. Thank you for your help!
