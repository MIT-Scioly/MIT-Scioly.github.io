                <p>
    Science Olympiad at MIT is an undergraduate student group founded in Fall
    2013 by Connor Duffy (2017) and Kenny Friedman (2017) with the mission of
    improving the Science Olympiad experience of high school students in
    Massachusetts and the greater northeast region. MIT Science Olympiad is
    entirely run by a team of MIT undergraduate
    students. We work around the year both within MIT and in the Massachusetts
    area to promote Science Olympiad opportunities for students. The MIT
    Invitational would not be possible without the dedication and effort of our
    members.
