            Hello! I’m Jonah, a junior majoring in Biological Engineering (Course 20). I competed for duPont Manual HS and my favorite events were Anatomy, Designer Genes, and Protein Modeling. Scioly was the bedrock of my high school years, so I’m excited to give back at MIT! On campus, you can also find me culturing bacteria in the BioMaker Space, studying kinases, and waiting in a stir fry line. Off campus, I’m likely slurping ramen with friends, on the Green Line, or attempting to grind in Boston Public Library!
