## Basic Codebase Rules

* Always run ```git pull``` before modifying the code to try and avoid merge conflicts.

* Always ```git push``` code after you finish modifying anything. Avoid having code checked out and modified for too long on your personal machine as this leads to merge conflicts.

* If you have any questions about Git or want help using it, let me know (preferably sooner rather than later). It's almost impossible for you to permanently break anything, but it would also be good to avoid messing stuff up since it could get complicated with multiple people.

## File Structure and Naming Conventions
* We will be following Jekyll standards for the most part.

## Code Conventions
* Use spaces instead of tabs. You should be able to set your text editor to do this (ask me if you're not sure).
* For html files, use two spaces per tab (keeps the indentation from growing too wide).
* For css and js, use four spaces per tab
