            I'm Julie, a junior studying Computer Science (6-3) and minoring in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (9). While competing in Div C (Palo Alto), I really enjoyed Anatomy & Physiology, Geologic Mapping, and Herpetology. It’s been incredibly rewarding to give back to the organization that helped me make so many good memories and friends. I'm also involved with Asian Dance Team, MedLinks, and Pi Beta Phi. In my free time, I love to bake, run (aka prevent baked goods from turning me into a potato), and play the ukulele.
