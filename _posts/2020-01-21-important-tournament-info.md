We hope you are all excited for our tournament this Saturday, January 25! This post contains very important information about the tournament day and registration. The details are summarized here, but please follow all links to make sure you are fully informed.

## Day-Of Registration
Registration is mandatory for all teams—one coach from each school must come to registration.

You can attend registration on either **Friday, January 24 from 5-7 PM** or on **Saturday, January 25 from 6-8 AM**. You must attend registration during one of these times, but there is no need to go to both times. Registration will be held in HQ: **10-105**, known as the Bush Room.

## Safety and Emergencies
Once you are on campus, **if you or any team members as an urgent medical emergency, please call the MIT Police at 617-253-1212. Please do not call 911 because the MIT Police are more familiar with the MIT campus and can respond more quickly.**

For any Science Olympiad-related emergencies during the competition, please contact one of the following three members of our team:
