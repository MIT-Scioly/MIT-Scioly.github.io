title: An Overview of the Events Committee
---

We are the Events committee, MIT Science Olympiad’s largest sub-committee and the backbone of the tournament! We manage all logistics related to the tournament’s 23 events and 3 trial events. While competitors rarely interact with us directly, you can see the impact of the decisions we make during the tournament itself from the exams that went through our thorough event review process to the venues and materials we acquired to host each event. 


Our responsibilities range from big decisions like selecting the current season’s event supervisors (ESs) to smaller yet essential tasks like getting MIT admin approval for our build and lab events. While our committee only has 10 members, we work closely with other committees whether it’s Admin Logs booking event venues/assisting with MIT admin approval, Comp Logs communicating Events details with coaches, or Finance reimbursing ES travel and purchasing materials. 

From the competitor's side, we may seem mysterious, so we hope this blog post gives both competitors and aspiring MIT ESs a good sense of what we do behind the scenes. Another aim is to show other invitationals how we organize our tournament structure so that we can all provide better experiences for future SciOly kids. 


One major benefit of organizing for MIT Science Olympiad is that we have years of past expertise and documentation to guide us through the process. For instance, we are eternally grateful for Yoshihiro Saito, 2021-22 Tournament Director, who still continues to help us by answering our numerous questions, coordinating some day-of logistics, and, of course, ESing.

At the end of the day, we are all college students being perpetually blasted by the MIT firehose, but we volunteer for SciOly because we are passionate about providing a meaningful experience for high schoolers around the country.
