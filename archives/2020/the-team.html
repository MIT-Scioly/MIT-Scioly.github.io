                <p>
    Science Olympiad at MIT is an undergraduate student group founded in Fall
    2013 by Connor Duffy (2017) and Kenny Friedman (2017) with the mission of
    improving the Science Olympiad experience of high school students in
    Massachusetts and the greater northeast region. MIT Science Olympiad is
    entirely run by a team of MIT undergraduate
    students. We work around the year both within MIT and in the Massachusetts
    area to promote Science Olympiad opportunities for students. The MIT
    Invitational would not be possible without the dedication and effort of our
    members.

I competed in Division C (Troy High School) and I got involved with MIT Science Olympiad to give back to an organization that made my high school experience a lot more fun. I currently work in the Littleton Lab and serve as Chief of MIT EMS. I love traveling and backpacking in my free time and am always looking to try something new. Looking forward to seeing everybody on January 25th!

I competed in both Division B (Beckendorff) and Division C (Seven Lakes), and SciOly was really the only competition I did that was both extremely interesting and so team dependent.
