---

With the 2021 MIT Science Olympiad Invitational approaching soon, we've released a [Competitor Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5I0B0gCLWU0Dznh1-_vvIAE_QWDBBHmMnc0NTjdunA/edit?usp=sharing) to provide answers to tournament-specific questions and serve as a main hub for resources regarding our virtual tournament. In addition, we're continuing to update the [Event Information](event-info) page, where trial event rules and other event-specific information or clarifications can be found.

**Please be sure to check out both of these resources for up-to-date information regarding our virtual tournament!**
