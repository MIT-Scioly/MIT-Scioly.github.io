                <h1> Event Information </h1>
                
                <p><em>Last updated: January 21, 2021</em></p>

<p>This page will continue to be updated as we finalize more details. Be sure to check back later for more information regarding our 2021 events.</p>

<h2 id="events-list">Events List</h2>

<p>Events will be run according to the eligible and replacement events on the <a href="https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/2021_MiniEvents_090820.pdf">miniSO event chart</a>, <strong>except for Gravity Vehicle</strong>. Replacement events will be run as trial events. <strong>Alternates may compete in the trial events.</strong></p>

<p>Events will use national-level rules. Any national and invitational event clarifications will be published on our Scilympiad page.</p>

<p><strong>All events will be open internet unless otherwise mentioned (Codebusters).</strong> However, no communication with other people, aside from your partner(s), is allowed. See <a href="test-taking">Test Taking</a> for additional test-taking information.</p>

<h2 id="codebusters">Codebusters</h2>

<p>The Codebusters Exam will be a normal test; the timed question has its own way of submitting online which will take the latest correct submission. If it is incorrect, you will be able to submit again. <strong>No online searching or computer assistance can be used for the test.</strong></p>

<h2 id="detector-building">Detector Building</h2>

<p>The Detector Building event will <strong>only consist of the exam portion, and there will be no device testing.</strong></p>

<h2 id="experimental-design">Experimental Design</h2>

<p>In so many ways, this event is hard to conduct virtually. That is why we have taken every effort to retain the integrity, accessibility, and spirit of the rules of the event when deciding to run it as part of the virtual tournament. We will attempt to adhere as closely to standard event structure as possible, and anything you need to know we’ve included below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No Pre-Written Exam</strong> - There will be no pre-written Data Analysis portion of the event, nor is there any kind of hypothetical experiment at play. Competitors are expected to design and conduct their experiment, collect their own data, and write up their report as would be expected in an in-person version of the event. Anything to the contrary is in violation of the spirit of the rules.</li>
  <li><strong>No Specialized Materials Required</strong> - We do not expect you to have specialized materials on hand to conduct an experiment for the event. All competitors should have the materials you need for anyone on the team to conduct the experiment.</li>
  <li><strong>IMPORTANT! Competitors Must Submit Any Diagrams/Data-Tables/Graphs to Official Dropbox</strong> - Due to limitations of the Scilympiad platform, we ask that competitors submit any diagrams/graphs/data-tables/relevant illustrated or visual aspects to report—to the official event dropbox. <strong>Submit only your FINAL visuals to the dropbox, using the filename format “[team name and number], [section header]”</strong>, e.g. “Super Great High School 005, 6. Procedure and Set-up Diagrams.” <em>If for any reason you experience technical difficulties with Dropbox, as a last-resort, please email a copy of your diagrams/tables/charts directly by email to <a href="mailto:scioly-expd@mit.edu">scioly-expd@mit.edu</a> instead before your 50-minute time limit elapses.</em></li>
  <li><strong>50-Minute Time Limit</strong> - Teams will be allotted the standard 50 minutes to complete the event and turn in <strong>BOTH</strong> Dropbox and Scilympiad submission. <em>Typically, time is reserved in competition to clean up materials and proof handwriting. For this virtual event, the time you get back from not having to do either (as well as time saved typing over handwriting) should be all the time you need to juggle digital submission. If for any reason you experience technical difficulties that force you to exceed your submission time past the 50 minute limit, please submit your responses and the copy as soon as possible and ask your coach to send me an email at <a href="mailto:scioly-expd@mit.edu">scioly-expd@mit.edu</a> with a note of explanation. If the technical difficulty is deemed invalid or you do not promptly provide a coach’s note, your team may be tiered, awarded a deduction, or disqualified at the supervising team’s discretion.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protein-modeling">Protein Modeling</h2>

<p>The Protein Modeling Exam will be run as closely to how it would have been in an in-person exam. Rules for the 2020-2021 season will be followed. There is NO pre-build section, and points are allotted so that 75% of the total score comes from the exam and 25% comes from an online JMOL computer exploration section, details of which are included in the test itself. All other rules provided by MIT Science Olympiad (open internet, etc) apply as well.</p>

<h2 id="sounds-of-music">Sounds of Music</h2>

<p>The Sounds of Music event will <strong>only consist of the exam portion, and there will be no device testing.</strong></p>

<h2 id="trial-event-write-it-cad-it">Trial Event: Write It CAD It</h2>

<p><a href="docs/WriteItCadItRules.pdf">Write It CAD It Rules</a></p>

<p>Write It CAD It will be using <strong><a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD Version 0.18.4</a></strong>. There will be two separate events for WICI on Scilympiad: one for the writer and one for the CADer. Please make sure that your coach has assigned the correct person (there should be only one person assigned to each). Writer will first start his/her test and have 25 mins to write the instruction in the provided text box with given screenshots of the build. The CADer will then start his/her test immediately after and have 20 mins to download the CAD files, assemble it, and upload it (instructions for upload and download will be on the test). Scilympiad should automatically handle showing the written instruction from the writer to the CADer.</p>
