        I’m Alice, Class of 2020, and I’m studying bioengineering (Course 20) and Brain & Cognitive Science (Course 9). My favorite SciOly event during high school was Anatomy and Physiology. I competed in Division C (Troy High School) and I got involved with MIT Science Olympiad to give back to an organization that made my high school experience a lot more fun. I currently work in the Littleton Lab and serve as Chief of MIT EMS. I love traveling and backpacking in my free time and am always looking to try something new. Looking forward to seeing everybody on January 25th!

        I’m Thomas, class of 2021 at MIT.  I'm studying mathematics (Course 18) and some computational biology (Course 6-7), and I'll be one of the tournament directors for the 2020 MIT Invitational. My favorite SciOly event has to be Dynamic Planet (all four versions are great, but oceanography is the best). I competed in both Division B (Beckendorff) and Division C (Seven Lakes), and SciOly was really the only competition I did that was both extremely interesting and so team dependent.  I'm also involved with Asian Dance Team at MIT and am part of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.

        Julia is a current Junior at MIT pursuing a double major in Chemistry and Geosciences. Julia is an alum of Hinsdale Central High School in Chicago, IL. In Division C she competed in a variety of Earth Science events, her favorite being Rocks & Minerals. Science Olympiad is where she made many of her best friends in high school and discovered her love for science, and she is excited to help pass on some of these experiences to current high school students. Julia is also passionate about hiking, camping, and backpacking, poker, and spending time with her friends.

        I’m Madison, a sophomore studying Biology and minoring in Neuroscience and Ancient and Medieval Studies. I’m one of two Events Directors--we select and support the Event Supervisors as they write exams and on tournament day. In high school, I competed for duPont Manual, and I especially enjoyed Herpetology, MatSci, and Game On. Here at MIT, I enjoy working on a research project in Ed Boyden’s lab, playing Smash Bros with my friends, and wandering around Boston.

        Hello! I’m Elaine and I’m a sophomore studying computer science as well as brain and cognitive sciences at MIT. I’m from Lincolnshire, Illinois where I competed for the Adlai E. Stevenson High School Science Olympiad team. My favorite event was Protein Modeling. I do Science Olympiad at MIT because I really enjoyed competing in high school and want to stay connected with the organization. I’m also involved in the Society of Women Engineers and MIT Borderline.

        Hi! I’m Susan and I am a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering with Biological Engineers. I competed in Science Olympiad at Martin Luther King High School and my favorite event was Anatomy and Physiology. I had always wanted to be a part of MIT SciOly since first hearing about the invitational in middle school! SciOly was the initial spark that piqued my interest in science and where I made some of my closest friends and fondest memories. Outside of Science Olympiad,I’m also in MIT Asian Dance Team, Associate Advising, China Development Initiative, and MIT Biotech Group.

        I’m Ilana, a sophomore studying Bioengineering and minoring in Spanish and PoliSci. My favorite event has been Forensics forever. I decided to get involved with MIT Scioly because my own experience with the MIT invite in high school persuaded me to apply to and ultimately attend the school! Besides Science Olympiad, I am also involved with GlobeMed @ MIT, Dance Troupe, and Kappa Alpha Theta. Hailing from the North Shore of Chicago, I attended New Trier High School. In my free time I enjoy photography, playing music, and forcing my friends on long walks along the river.
