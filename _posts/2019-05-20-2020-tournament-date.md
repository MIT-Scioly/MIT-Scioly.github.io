---

We are pleased to announce that the sixth annual MIT Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will be held on **Saturday, January 25th, 2020**, on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA.

We will be running all 23 Division C national events, including lab and engineering events, with a schedule mirroring the National Tournament schedule as closely as possible. All events will be written, reviewed, and run by Science Olympiad alumni currently at MIT, national tournament event supervisors, and/or former Science Olympiad competitors from the highest level of competition.

We would also like to welcome Thomas Xiong (‘21) to join Alice Lin (‘20) as our tournament directors for the 2020 season as we say goodbye to Joshua Segaran (‘19) and wish him luck on his future endeavors.

Tournament registration will open mid-September. Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mitscioly) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mit_scioly/) to stay updated with our team.

We look forward to welcoming you all next January!
