<h2 id="california-online-privacy-protection-act">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the world that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more <a href="https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">here</a></p>

<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above. You can change your personal information by emailing us or by logging in to your account.</p>

<p>We do not respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>

<h2 id="coppa-children-online-privacy-protection-act">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which specifies what operators of commercial websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not collect information from children under the age of 13. Only coaches should be filling out information, and the information should be about no students below the age of 13.</p>
