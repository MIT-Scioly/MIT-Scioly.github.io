<p>
    For teams that have confirmed their attendance with us, you should have received an email with our W9 and an invoice. Please send a check addressed to MIT Science Olympiad for $130 per team to our PO box (PO 397105, Cambridge, MA 02139) by November 22nd, 2019. We will soon be in touch regarding the checks we have and have not received as well as invoices for individuals who need a formal receipt. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at <a href="mailto:scioly@mit.edu">scioly@mit.edu</a>.
</p>
<h2>Team Roster</h2>
<p>
    Please submit a team roster by <b>December 5th</b> at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7fFER4zTd9hkBJC10YBQBx6G_BhCuZaH8VrOhmFn4AMqzIw/viewform">link</a>. You will receive an email receipt to edit your submission since we recognize that team rosters may change over time. However, we are asking that that this form be submitted by December 5th, so we can set up self-scheduling using the Avogadro usernames (see below).
</p>
<p>
    You will be able to keep track of which of your students have submitted what forms through a custom spreadsheet link that has been emailed to you. This sheet will be updated to reflect this information after December 5th.
</p>

<h2>Avogadro and Self-Scheduling</h2>
<p>
    The roster form above asks for an Avogadro username. If you do not have an Avogadro account yet, please sign up for one on the <a href="https://avogadro.ws">Avogadro website</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Access to self-scheduled events will open on <b>December 10th at 5PM EST</b> and will be done through Avogadro. Another email with more details on self-scheduling will be sent closer to the date. Please be sure to fill out the roster form above by December 5 so that we can add your school to our Avogadro tournament.
</p>

<h2>MIT Liability Form</h2>
<p>
    Please make sure the <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/0eb1fa09-b071-4e92-a522-21018fec598e?env=na2">MIT liability form</a> is submitted for each student (alternates included) attending the invitational by <b>December 31st</b>.
</p>
<p>
    This form needs to be signed by a parent or a legal guardian. <b>Note that when you first open the link, it asks for the name of the parent and not the student's name.</b> Please follow this instruction since otherwise it will not work properly.
</p>
