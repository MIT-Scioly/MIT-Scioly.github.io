          <em>Last updated: January 9, 2019</em>

          <h2>Disease Detectives</h2>
          <p>
            Disease Detectives will be held in the 7:30AM-8:30AM time slot. Since there is no 15 minute gap between this time slot and the next time slot, we will be starting the event at exactly 7:30AM and expect students participating in Disease Detectives to be in the testing room at 7:20AM exactly so that the event can end by 8:20AM at latest, giving students a ten minute window to get to their next exam. Please keep in mind that we will be checking wristbands at this event as well. Given that some schools may be running slightly late in the morning, we’ve arranged for this event to be held in the room directly above HQ. If your school is running late with registration and is worried about the wrist band check and making it to Disease Detectives on time (for our early morning arrivals), please have your students participating Disease Detectives come with you to HQ during registration— we’ll have a volunteer shuttle students up to the event so that we can start on time.
          </p>

          <h2>Protein Modeling</h2>
          <p>
            Protein Modeling will not be using the Mini Toober from 3D Molecular Designs. Instead, we will be using a foam wire tie substitute that can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026WGDYW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">here</a>. Amino acids will be indicated with tacks and termini will be indicated with colored tape. All other aspects of the on-site section will be standard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, per national-level rules, each team may only bring ONE sheet of notes (double-sided) to the event.
          </p>

          <h2>Wright Stuff</h2>
          <p>Wright Stuff will take place in La Sala de Puerto Rico (W20-202) in the Student Center. Current dimensions of the room are 48' x 124’ and 29' tall. The room is pictured below.</p>
