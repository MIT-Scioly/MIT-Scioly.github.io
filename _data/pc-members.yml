        Current senior and MEng at MIT. Studies math and computational biology. Competed in Science Olympiad at Seven Lakes High School; favorite events were earth science focused, but sadly has not studied much earth science at MIT.  Loves hanging out with friends and playing cello. Strong proponent of the belief that the best parts of MIT lie outside of classes.

        Hello! I'm Melissa, class of 2024, and I'm hoping to study biology and computer science. I went to high school in Minnesota, where I participated in Science Olympiad every year and served as captain in senior year. My favorite event was Anatomy & Physiology, although Microbe Mission was a great time too before it was cycled out. Science Olympiad was one of my highlights from high school, and I hope that I can help inspire that same passion in others. Aside from science, I really like to draw! I mostly do digital art and sometimes dabble in graphic design.
